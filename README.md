Scripts for the Hak5 Key croc

---

## Setting up Node.js

The Key Croc runs on Linux. To use the scripts I have created, you need to install Node.js onto it.

Here is a quick guide on how to do it:

1. Boot the Key Croc into `Arming Mode` (blue status LED) by pressing the hidden button.
2. Access the serial console, under Linux, type `sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200` (you may have to install the `screen` package via apt). For other operating systems, please refer to the [official guide](https://docs.hak5.org/key-croc/basics/serial-console-access).
